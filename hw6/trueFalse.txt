1 F there is a worse case scenario where all pairs have to be compared
2 F the growth cannot be bounded by log(n) in all scenarios
3 F the growth can be faster than N
4 T the upper bound is N comparisons
5 F since N^2 is slower than N, it can also be the upper bound of put
6 T Josh mentioned natural logs in lecture
7 F depends on the implementation of containsKey, and the location of c and k within map
8 O(N^2) for the else return case, it is possible to go through N nodes, and numberofNodes has a runtime of N
